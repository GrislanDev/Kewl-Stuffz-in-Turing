# Kewl-Stuffz-in-Turing
Though Turing 4.1 isn't the best language to learn as an intro to coding it can still be used to make awesome things. 
I've placed demonstration projects in here to show what you can do with Turing. 
Note: Most of these projects use things we haven't learned in ICS20. 
Try to figure out how they work, or email me if you have any questions.

This code is intended for you to learn and find new ideas. The concepts displayed here are owned by nobody.
In no circumstance are you allowed to take credit for this code (for example, if you use it in a project).
